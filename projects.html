				<h3>Smartwatch</h3>
				<p> The design of the watch was built on the philosophy that the practicality
					of a smartwatch does not require the powerful internals of the mainstream watches. Effective
					watches will be the ones that work well and priced that the average person can justify the costs.
					My watch was built with the intent to be produced for under $25. It's form factor will be modelled 
					after a Timex Weekender. The internals will be ATMEGA microcontroller, OLED display, inertial measurement unit
					for gesture based UI, heart rate monitor for fitness tracking, and 
					Bluetooth 4 Low Energy for communication. 
					Also currently designing an Android app for pairing and settings menu.
